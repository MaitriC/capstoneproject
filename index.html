    Don't you'll know that we are living on mother Earth. 
    so mother Earth should be the mother of all the humans. 
    The way how we take care of our mothers can't we take care of the mother of this whole world.
    Mother Earth is still standing all alone on so much of load and has never done any harm to us but each and everyday we, humans are always throwing garbage on our own mother.
