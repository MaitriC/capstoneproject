    <p id="paragraph2"> <h4>Can you all the see the different types of pollution. These are the pollutions that we create.
        Now let me tell you the problems that pollution causes.
Pollution is the introduction or presence of harmful substances or contaminants into the natural environment that causes adverse effects.
Pollution not only hurts the planet, but it is also harmful to humans. Air pollution caused by the burning of fossil fuels in factories, cars, airplanes, and electricity cause health problems such as breathing problems, worsening of asthma, and even congenital disabilities. 
Non-communicable diseases account for 72% of all deaths, 16% of which are caused by toxic pollution. Toxic pollution is responsible for 22% of all cardiovascular disease, 25% of stroke deaths, 40% of lung cancer deaths, and 53% of deaths from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
The Earth's soil and water can also become polluted from littering or the dumping of chemicals by industries and individuals. This pollution can damage ecosystems, negatively affect plants and trees, and contaminate our drinking water.
Air pollution is caused by solid and liquid particles and certain gases that are suspended in the air. These particles and gases can come from car and truck exhaust, factories, dust, pollen, mold spores, volcanoes and wildfires.
These are the problems that are caused due to pollution.
