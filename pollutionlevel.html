    <h1>Pollution Level In Different Countries And Why Are They Polluted</h1>
<p id="paragraph4"><h4>
    Bangladesh
    Bangladesh is the most polluted country in the world, with an average PM2.5 concentration of 83.30. 
    The country's primary environmental pollutants are air and water pollution, groundwater contamination, noise pollution, and solid wastes. 
    Dhaka City is one of the most polluted cities in the world. 
    In terms of air pollution, Bangladesh's largest source is its brickmaking industry, which employs one million people and creates 23 billion bricks every year.
     The kilns used in brickmaking burn wood or coal and create mass amounts of smoke and dust. Due to increased demand for bricks, the brickmaking industry is only expected to grow more, leading to more air pollution.
 <br>
</br>
    Pakistan
    The second-most polluted country in the world is Pakistan, which has an average PM2.5
     concentration of 65.81. AQI levels in Punjab were consistently between the "near unhealthy" or "very unhealthy" ratings for most of 2019 and even reached as high as 484. 
     Pakistan is experiencing rising pollution from the growing number of vehicles on the roads, large-scale losses of trees, smoke from bricks kiln and steel mills, and the burning of garbage. 
<br>
</br>
Mongolia
Mongolia is the third-most polluted country in the world. Mongolia's average PM2.5 concentration is 62.00. 
The largest pollution source in Mongolia is the burning of coal and other biomass, such as wood or crop residue, in stoves. 
In Mongolia's capital, Ulan Bator, respiratory infections have increased 270% over the last ten years, and children that live in the capital city have a 40% lower lung function than those living in rural areas. 
About 70-90% of pregnant mothers being treated at a family health center in Mongolia are negatively impacted by air pollution. Infants as young as two days old are being diagnosed with pneumonia or other respiratory illnesses.
<br>
</br>
Afghanistan
Afghanistan is the fourth-most polluted country in the world, with an average PM2.5 level of 58.80. 
In 2017, numbers show that air pollution was more dangerous than the war in Afghanistan. 
That year, about 26,000 people lost their lives due to air pollution-related diseases while 3,483 people lost their lives due to conflict. 
About 80% of drinking water in Afghanistan is polluted as well due to low rainfall, irregular use of groundwater, and insufficient infrastructure in cities. 
The lack of clean drinking water commonly results in food poisoning.
<br>
</br>
India
India the fifth-most polluted country in the world, with an average PM2.5 concentration of 50.08. 
Of the 30 most polluted cities in the world, 21 of them are located in India. 
The most polluted city in India and the world is Kanpur, where the city's medical college receives about 600 respiratory illness patients per month. 
India's unhealthy pollution levels are from sources such as vehicles, the burning of coal and wood, dust storms, and forest fires.
 Delhi, India's capital region, is notorious for some of the worst air in India, forcing flight cancellations, causing traffic accidents, closing of schools, and even turned the white marble walls of the Taj Mahal green.
<br>
</br>
Indonesia
Indonesia's average PM2.5 concentration is 51.71.
 About 250,000 people die in Indonesia every year because of pollution exposure, the fourth-highest premature pollution deaths in the world. 
 Millions of children are exposed to poor air quality every year, causing them to miss school and leading to possible lifelong physical and cognitive damage. 
 A few decades ago, Indonesia's air quality was considered among the cleanest in the world, while it is the sixth-most polluted globally today.
<br>
</br>
Bahrain
The fifth-most polluted country in the world is Bahrain, which has an average PM2.5 of 59.80. 
Bahrain has the worst air pollution in the Middle East. 
A Gulf country like Bahrain may not suffer from pollution caused by coal power plants or other human activity seen in cities, but rather from dust and sand storms that can pick up several harmful chemicals and even radioactive materials from as far as the Sahara.
<br>
</br>
Nepal
The seventh-most polluted country in the world is Nepal. 
Nepal's average PM2.5 concentration is 44.46. 
About 35,000 people in Nepal die every year from illnesses caused by air pollution. 
About 1 in 10 Nepalese now suffer from a chronic lung problem such as bronchitis or emphysema due to Nepal's worsening air conditions. 
A baby born today in Nepal is expected to have a two-year shorter life expectancy solely due to problems caused by the air. 
In the country's capital, Kathmandu, 80% of vehicles on the road are motorcycles, which are one of the leading urban polluters in addition to brick kilns.
<br>
</br>
Uzbekistan
Uzbekistan's average PM2.5 concentration is 41.20. 
According to the World Health Organization, Uzbekistan has the third-highest death rate associated with outdoor pollution in the world. 
Air quality in Uzbekistan, especially around Tashkent, is better during the spring and summer and worse during colder temperatures. 
Much of the country's pollution is from poor water management, heavy use of agricultural chemicals, salt and dust storms, factories, and auto emissions (only in Tashkent and Farghona).
<br>
</br>
Iraq
Iraq has the tenth-worst air pollution with an average PM2.5 concentration of 39.60. 
Iraq's poor air quality contributors are vehicle emissions, war-induced pollution, power generators, and small fires, mostly from oil and gas refineries. 
In 2016, researchers found that exposure to war-induced pollution, including explosions and the burning of military waste, is a cause of congenital disabilities and cancers.
